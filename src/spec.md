# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Enhance the marketing site with customer testimonials, a new pests/insects information page, and more detailed service treatment guidance.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a “Customer Reviews” section to the Home page with at least 6 static testimonial cards (reviewer name, star rating, short review text, optional service type), styled to match the existing theme and responsive.
- Create a new “Pests & Insects” page (e.g., `/pests`) featuring a responsive grid/list of common pests (e.g., cockroaches, termites, mosquitoes, bed bugs, ants, rodents), each with identification details, typical signs, and basic prevention tips; add links to this page in both the header and footer navigation.
- Expand the Services page with an “Our Treatment Process” section describing clear steps (inspection, identification, treatment, prevention, follow-up) and add plain-English safety notes (family/pet safety, preparation, aftercare, eco-friendly options) in a scannable layout consistent with current styling.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can read customer testimonials on the Home page, browse a dedicated Pests & Insects page from the site navigation, and view clearer, more detailed treatment process and safety information on the Services page.
