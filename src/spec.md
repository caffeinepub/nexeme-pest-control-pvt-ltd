## Summary
**Goal:** Create a responsive marketing website for Nexeme Pest Control Pvt Ltd with core business pages, clear services info, prominent contact details, consistent professional theming (non-blue/purple primary palette), and basic SEO metadata.

**Planned changes:**
- Build 4 navigable, responsive pages/sections: Home, Services, About, Contact, with desktop and mobile-friendly navigation.
- Add a Services section listing common pest control categories (at least 5) with short English descriptions in a scannable layout.
- Show contact details prominently on the Contact page and in the footer: Phone 9053146001 (tel: link) and Email inkhiya14@gmail.com (mailto: link).
- Apply a cohesive visual theme (colors/typography/spacing/component styling) appropriate for a pest control business, avoiding a blue/purple-dominant primary palette.
- Add basic SEO and sharing metadata: document title, meta description, and Open Graph title/description using “Nexeme Pest Control Pvt Ltd”.
- Add and use generated static images (logo and hero) from `frontend/public/assets/generated` in header/footer and Home hero.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can browse a professional, mobile-friendly Nexeme Pest Control Pvt Ltd website, view services and company information, and quickly contact the business via clickable phone/email links.
